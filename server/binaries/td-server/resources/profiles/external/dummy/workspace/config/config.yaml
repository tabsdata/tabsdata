# Modes of arguments-passing to workers:
#
# parameters: Arguments to pass directly to the process. The values are provided
#             explicitly and support resolution of environment variables within
#             them.
#
# inherit...: Arguments to pass to the process. The values are derived from the
#             value passed to the same argument in the parent process, allowing
#             inheritance across process chains.
#
# arguments.: Arguments to pass to the process. The values are automatically
#             generated using an internal algorithm based on reserved keywords.
#
# markers...: Arguments to pass to the process. For ephemeral workers, the
#             process is wrapped in a system shell script. As a result, all the
#             argument types above are embedded directly into the script, not
#             passed as command-line arguments.
#             Marker values, however, are passed as direct arguments to the
#             script itself, and are also generated using an internal algorithm
#             based on reserved keywords. These values ar normally used to tag
#             processes for easier tracking.
#
# get-state.: Arguments to pass to the process. The values are generated from an
#             internal key-value map, which is populated by workers that use the
#             'set-state' attribute. These arguments are not passed via the
#             command line, but instead are delivered through the processâ€™s
#             standard input (stdin).
